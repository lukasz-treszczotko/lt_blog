A well known fact about the fractional Brownian motion is that it is not a semimartingale and in particular it cannot be written as a stochastic integral with respect to a Brownian motion and, at the same time, be adapted to this Brownian motion. However, there is a representation of fractional Brownian motion (see for example Chapter 6 in [Pipiras and Taqquu]https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/longrange-dependence-and-selfsimilarity/EC0867FA235989C077341B00822BF829), which says that for any {% raw %}
$$a>0$$ {% endraw %}, and {% raw %} $$ (W_s)_{s\in[0,a]} $$ {% endraw %}

{% raw %}
$$a(r)$$
{% endraw %}
