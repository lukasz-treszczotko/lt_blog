I am a PhD student in probability in the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Warsaw. My research interests include long-range dependence, particle systems, local times and  stochastic volatility. Quite recently I also became interested in
probabilistic machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian nonparametric models.

You can find my CV here [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cv.pdf).

My arXiv profile is

<https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Treszczotko%2C+%C5%81>

I am always trying hard ... as in this picture:)
